# Write the Python code of a program that reads two numbers from the user, and prints their sum product, and difference.
#Hint: subtract the second number from the first one =======================================================Example 1:
# Sample Input: 4 and 5
# Sample Output:
#Sum = 9
#product = 20
#Difference = -1

num_1 = 4
num_2 = 5

sumResult = num_1 + num_2

sumProductResult = num_1 * num_2

productDefference = num_1 - num_2


print("Sum Result : ", sumResult  )
print("Sum Product Result : ", sumProductResult)
print("Product Defference : ", productDefference)
